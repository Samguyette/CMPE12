LEARNING
What I learned in this program is how to perform for loops and if statments without using
actual built in functions, like say java. What I also learned was how a registar is used
behind the scene of some of these high level langauges. How it can store in the RAM
then allocated space in the drive and eventually overide the value if needed.
What I found supprising is how many levels deep this program or any program in mips can
go. I am using to following recusion in a systimatic almost linear way. Programs like 
FEEDBABE goes all directions and can be hard to follow. What worked well is labeling 
methods and registar comments precisly so that they don't get lost or over written by
acciedint. What didn't work well is trying to write the program all in "one" method.

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS

1.
I theory N can be as big as your processor in your computer. The minute the processing 
power needed becomes larger than what it can suply it fails.

2.
((2^32)/2)-1

3.
One of the pseudo-ops I used was moveTo. The way the processor interprets these commands
access the instructions for the built in func.

4.
I used 9 registars in this program. The way I could have used less registars would be 
to overrite ones that I don't need anymore. Since that would use one already in use
rather than using a new one.
