LEARNING

Huge thing I learned was how to debug. I used LED lights to run through the probelm and slowly get closer and closer to the error. I also learned practical uses for flip flops and how to store data at a very low level (binary.) I also learned that one of the best ways to do these programs is to write it all out on paper before starting to move logic gates around.

ISSUES

Huge issue that I had was the type of flip flop. I had it set slave master which was the wrong type (it has the input inverted.) The program went pretty smooth besides that.

----------------
DEBUGGING

Like I uncluded earlier a very easy way to debug is to set up LEDs places you think the error is and keep making the gap between the two LEDs smaller until you finally find out where the error is.

QUESTIONS

What is the difference between a bit-wise and reduction logic operation?
If I interprate the question right bit-wise deals with binary representation of data and logic operations deal with statements.

What operations did we implement?
The operations we had were Store, AND, OR, and Inverse.
All these operations were bit-wise.

Why might we want to use the other type of logic operations?
I would imagine if you are writing code or dealing with a computer you would use bit-wise. If you are computicating with humans or trying to explain something you use logic operations
