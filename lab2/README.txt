A way to make a display without MML would be to use and gates to see which spots were true and from that do the binary calculations manually. (Using java this would be easy, not exactly sure how it would be done in MML.)

I would imagine the random number generator isn't too random. But im sure it has a long list of ones and zeros programed into it that it runs through and appear to be "random."

They can't actually be TRUELY random.

Lab Report:
I think taking EE80T and discrete math prepared me for the logic type thinking for this lab. Most of the questions seemed to be straight forward without problems. I think what works well for any scematic is taking it to paper. What I did for part C is took the table and used product of sums and OR all of the 1s together. From that it was easy to visualise how the schematic should end up looking. What doesn't work well is trying to construct a scematic "freehand." Never ends well. One thing that also never works is winebottler, very unfortunate the software isn't compatable on MAC OS. I don't believe I was supprised by anything on this lab, everything went pretty smoothly.
